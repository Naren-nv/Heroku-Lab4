# Fish Species Prediction Flask Application

This Flask application predicts the species of a fish based on its weight and length1 using a RandomForestClassifier model. The model was trained on a dataset containing information about various fish species.

## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to develop a web application that allows users to predict the species of a fish based on its weight and length1. This prediction can be useful for fishery management, aquatic research, and other related fields.

## Dataset

The model was trained on a dataset that includes the following columns:
- Species: The species of the fish (target variable).
- Weight: Weight of the fish (in grams).
- Length1: Length1 of the fish (in cm).
- Length2: Length2 of the fish (in cm).
- Length3: Length3 of the fish (in cm).
- Height: Height of the fish (in cm).
- Width: Width of the fish (in cm).

## Model Type

The application uses a RandomForestClassifier model to predict the species of a fish. RandomForest is a popular ensemble learning technique that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions.

## Installation

To run the application locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd your-repository`
3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
